# MyCatApplicationJava
A lightweight Java Swing application that displays cat images retrieved from the [cat API](https://thecatapi.com/).

## Purpose

This project is part of my personal challenge to create basic GUI applications in a variety of programming languages.

The aim is to explore different programming languages in a deeper way, incorporating:

* Web queries
* Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs)
*Basic multithreading

## Dependencies

This project uses the following external libraries:

* [jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson) - [v2.18.1](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson/wiki/Jackson-Release-2.18.1)
